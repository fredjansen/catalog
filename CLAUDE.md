# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a new "catalogo" (catalog) project repository. The codebase is currently empty and awaiting initial setup.

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty repository, the following steps will likely be needed:

1. Initialize the project with appropriate technology stack
2. Set up package management (package.json for Node.js, requirements.txt for Python, etc.)
3. Configure build tools and development scripts
4. Add initial project structure

## Common Commands

*Commands will be added once the project structure is established*

## Architecture Notes

*Architecture information will be added as the project develops*

## Important Considerations

- The project name "catalogo" suggests this may be a catalog/inventory management system
- Consider the target language/framework when initializing the project
- Ensure proper project structure is established before adding features
